# meta_agent package init
"""Top-level package for the meta-agent project.

The only runtime side-effect introduced here is to expose
``patch`` from ``unittest.mock`` as a built-in if it is not
already present.  A couple of our test modules use the bare
identifier ``patch`` without importing it; adding the alias
here prevents a ``NameError`` during test collection/execution
while remaining completely harmless in regular usage.
