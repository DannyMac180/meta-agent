# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Guardrail Designer Sub-agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the specialized sub-agent that generates validation logic and guardrails for the agent.
# Details:
1. Configure gpt-4.1 model integration
2. Implement guardrail generation logic using Pydantic models
3. Create test cases for guardrail validation
4. Implement policy check generators
5. Add regex pattern creation for input/output validation
6. Create hooks into Agents SDK guardrail system
7. Generate documentation for implemented guardrails

# Test Strategy:
Test with various guardrail specifications. Verify guardrails catch problematic inputs/outputs. Test against common evasion techniques.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Model Integration Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement the architecture for integrating the Guardrail Designer Sub-agent with the core AI model(s), ensuring modularity, scalability, and secure communication.
### Details:
Technical requirements: Support for multiple LLMs, agent-based orchestration, secure API endpoints, and clear separation between guardrail logic and model inference. Potential challenges: Ensuring compatibility with different model APIs, minimizing latency, and maintaining security boundaries. Acceptance criteria: Architecture diagram, interface specifications, and a working prototype that routes requests through the guardrail layer before reaching the model.

## 2. Implement Guardrail Generation Logic with Pydantic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop the core logic for generating and validating guardrail configurations using Pydantic models for type safety and schema enforcement.
### Details:
Technical requirements: Define Pydantic schemas for guardrail rules (e.g., denied topics, content filters, PII redaction), support dynamic rule creation, and ensure validation of user-supplied configurations. Potential challenges: Handling complex nested rules, maintaining extensibility, and providing clear error messages. Acceptance criteria: Pydantic models with comprehensive validation, unit tests for schema correctness, and example configurations.

## 3. Develop Comprehensive Test Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create a suite of automated tests covering all guardrail logic, including edge cases and failure scenarios.
### Details:
Technical requirements: Unit tests for each guardrail component, integration tests for end-to-end flows, and mock data for sensitive scenarios. Potential challenges: Simulating adversarial inputs, ensuring test coverage for all policy branches, and maintaining test isolation. Acceptance criteria: >90% code coverage, passing tests for all critical paths, and CI integration.

## 4. Implement Policy Check Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Develop mechanisms to enforce policy checks at runtime, ensuring all model outputs comply with defined guardrails.
### Details:
Technical requirements: Real-time evaluation of outputs against policy rules, support for custom policy plugins, and logging of violations. Potential challenges: Balancing performance with thoroughness, supporting policy updates without downtime, and handling ambiguous cases. Acceptance criteria: Policy checks block or redact non-compliant outputs, logs are generated for violations, and policies can be updated dynamically.

## 5. Create Regex Patterns for Content Filtering [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Design and test robust regex patterns for detecting and filtering prohibited content, PII, and sensitive topics.
### Details:
Technical requirements: Regex patterns for various content types (e.g., emails, phone numbers, banned phrases), support for internationalization, and performance optimization. Potential challenges: Avoiding false positives/negatives, maintaining readability, and updating patterns as requirements evolve. Acceptance criteria: Regex patterns pass all test cases, are documented, and can be easily extended.

## 6. Integrate with Existing SDKs and APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Connect the Guardrail Designer Sub-agent with relevant SDKs and APIs for model inference, logging, and monitoring.
### Details:
Technical requirements: SDK integration for LLMs, logging frameworks, and monitoring tools; support for asynchronous operations; and error handling. Potential challenges: Managing SDK version compatibility, handling API rate limits, and ensuring secure credential management. Acceptance criteria: Successful end-to-end integration, error handling for all SDK calls, and monitoring hooks in place.

## 7. Generate Comprehensive Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6
### Description: Produce detailed documentation covering architecture, guardrail logic, API usage, configuration, and extension guidelines.
### Details:
Technical requirements: Architecture diagrams, code examples, API references, and troubleshooting guides. Potential challenges: Keeping documentation up to date with code changes, ensuring clarity for different audiences, and covering edge cases. Acceptance criteria: Documentation reviewed by stakeholders, published in an accessible format, and includes examples for all major features.
