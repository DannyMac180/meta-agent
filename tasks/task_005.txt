# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Guardrail Designer Sub-agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the specialized sub-agent that generates validation logic and guardrails for the agent.
# Details:
1. Configure gpt-4o model integration
2. Implement guardrail generation logic using Pydantic models
3. Create test cases for guardrail validation
4. Implement policy check generators
5. Add regex pattern creation for input/output validation
6. Create hooks into Agents SDK guardrail system
7. Generate documentation for implemented guardrails

# Test Strategy:
Test with various guardrail specifications. Verify guardrails catch problematic inputs/outputs. Test against common evasion techniques.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Guardrail Designer Sub-agent with Model Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the base structure for the Guardrail Designer Sub-agent and integrate the gpt-4o model for guardrail generation capabilities.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a new GuardrailDesignerAgent class that inherits from the base Agent class
2. Configure the connection to gpt-4o model with appropriate system prompts for guardrail design
3. Implement the basic agent interface methods (initialize, process_request, generate_response)
4. Create a configuration class to store guardrail designer settings
5. Implement proper error handling for model API failures
6. Set up logging for guardrail generation activities

Testing approach:
1. Create unit tests to verify model connection and basic prompt handling
2. Test the agent initialization with various configuration parameters
3. Mock the model responses to test error handling paths

## 2. Implement Core Guardrail Generation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop the core logic for generating validation rules, Pydantic models, and regex patterns based on input specifications.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create specialized methods for different types of guardrails (input validation, output validation, policy checking)
2. Implement Pydantic model generation logic with type inference capabilities
3. Build regex pattern generator for string validation
4. Create a policy check generator that can produce validation logic for content policies
5. Implement a guardrail template system for common validation patterns
6. Design a structured output format for generated guardrails
7. Add context-aware guardrail suggestion based on agent purpose

Testing approach:
1. Create test cases with various input scenarios to verify generated Pydantic models
2. Test regex pattern generation with edge cases
3. Verify policy check generators with simulated harmful inputs
4. Validate that generated guardrails properly enforce the intended constraints

## 3. Integrate with Agent SDK and Create Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Connect the Guardrail Designer to the Agents SDK guardrail system and generate comprehensive documentation for the implemented guardrails.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create hooks into the Agents SDK guardrail system for seamless integration
2. Implement a guardrail registration mechanism to activate generated guardrails
3. Build a documentation generator that explains each implemented guardrail
4. Create sample usage examples for different types of guardrails
5. Implement test case generation for validating guardrails
6. Add a guardrail visualization component for easier understanding
7. Create a feedback mechanism to improve guardrail effectiveness

Testing approach:
1. Integration tests with the full Agent SDK to verify guardrail activation
2. Test documentation generation for accuracy and completeness
3. Verify test case generation produces valid test scenarios
4. End-to-end tests with various agents using the generated guardrails
5. User acceptance testing for documentation clarity
