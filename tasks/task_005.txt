# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the sub-agent responsible for generating tool code and unit tests
# Details:
Implement Tool Designer using o4-mini-high model:
- Accept tool specifications from Meta Agent
- Generate Python code for each tool
- Create unit tests for each tool
- Package as ToolArtifact objects
- Implement web search capability for API documentation lookup
- Add Python interpreter integration for code validation

Include template library for common tool patterns

# Test Strategy:
Test with sample tool specifications; verify generated code compiles and passes tests in sandbox; check edge cases like complex APIs
