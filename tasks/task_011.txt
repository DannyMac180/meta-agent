# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Tool Designer Sub-agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Designs and generates code for tools required by the agent based on the specification
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Tool Specification Parser [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a module that can parse and validate tool specifications provided by users or other agents, extracting key information needed for tool generation.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a `ToolSpecificationParser` class that can accept tool specifications in various formats (JSON, YAML, or structured text)
2. Implement validation logic to ensure specifications contain required fields (name, purpose, input parameters, output format)
3. Add methods to extract and normalize tool requirements from specifications
4. Include error handling for malformed specifications
5. Create unit tests with various specification formats to verify parsing accuracy
6. Test with edge cases like missing fields, unusual parameter types

Testing approach:
- Create a test suite with sample tool specifications in different formats
- Verify parser correctly extracts all required information
- Test error handling with deliberately malformed specifications

## 2. Implement Tool Code Generator [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Build a code generation system that can transform parsed tool specifications into executable Python code implementing the requested tool functionality.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a `ToolCodeGenerator` class that accepts parsed tool specifications
2. Implement template-based code generation for common tool patterns
3. Add support for different tool types (API callers, data processors, etc.)
4. Include docstring and type hint generation in created tools
5. Implement validation of generated code (syntax checking)
6. Add unit tests to verify code generation quality
7. Create a mechanism to handle dependencies required by generated tools

Testing approach:
- Generate code for a variety of tool types and verify syntax correctness
- Test generated tools with sample inputs to verify functionality
- Verify proper error handling in generated code
- Check that generated code follows best practices (type hints, documentation)

## 3. Create Tool Designer Agent Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Develop the main Tool Designer sub-agent that coordinates the specification parsing and code generation, providing a unified interface for other parts of the system.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a `ToolDesignerAgent` class that orchestrates the tool design process
2. Implement methods to accept tool requests from other agents or users
3. Add workflow logic to: parse specifications, generate code, test generated tools
4. Include feedback mechanisms for reporting success/failure of tool creation
5. Implement tool registration with the main agent system
6. Add caching of previously designed tools to avoid regeneration
7. Create comprehensive logging of the tool design process
8. Develop integration tests for the complete workflow

Testing approach:
- Test end-to-end workflow with various tool specifications
- Verify proper integration with the main agent system
- Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Verify logging and monitoring capabilities
- Test performance with complex tool specifications
