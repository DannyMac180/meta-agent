## 5. Implement LLM-backed Code Generation for Tools [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: The core framework for LLM-backed code generation for tools is implemented (see LLMCodeGenerator and its components). Current focus for this task is to ensure LLMService correctly integrates with the intended LLM provider endpoints (e.g., standard OpenAI /v1/chat/completions vs. the currently implemented /v1/responses endpoint), including request/response handling and code extraction logic in _extract_code_from_response.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design effective prompts for the LLM to generate tool implementation code based on specifications
2. Implement a service to handle LLM API calls with appropriate error handling and retries
3. Create a context builder that provides relevant information to the LLM (tool purpose, input/output formats, constraints)
4. Implement code parsing and validation to ensure generated code meets requirements
5. Add a mechanism to inject the generated implementation into the tool template
6. Implement fallback strategies for when code generation fails

Testing approach:
- Test the prompt effectiveness with various tool types
- Verify generated code compiles and functions correctly
- Test error handling and fallbacks
- Create integration tests with sample tool specifications

## 6. Integrate Tool Designer with Main Agent Workflow [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the Tool Designer sub-agent with the main agent workflow and implement the end-to-end process for tool creation
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement the main workflow for tool creation: specification → code generation → validation → registration
2. Add functionality to dynamically load and register newly created tools with the main agent
3. Implement a caching mechanism for previously generated tools to avoid redundant generation
4. Create a feedback loop mechanism where the main agent can request modifications to tools
