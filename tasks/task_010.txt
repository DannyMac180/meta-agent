# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Diagram Generation and UX Enhancements
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Add visual diagram generation and improve the user experience with colored output and progress indicators.
# Details:
1. Implement Mermaid diagram generation for agent architecture
2. Add colored CLI output for status indicators
3. Create progress bars for long-running operations
4. Implement --audit command for guardrail inspection
5. Add diff view for agent iterations
6. Create interactive mode for specification refinement
7. Implement error suggestions for failed generations

# Test Strategy:
Test diagram generation with various agent complexities. Verify colored output works across different terminals. Test interactive mode with intentionally ambiguous specifications.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design module architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a high-level design for separating diagram generation, CLI output, and interactive features into distinct modules
### Details:
Define clear interfaces between modules, establish communication patterns, and document the overall architecture. Include module responsibilities, data flow diagrams, and dependency management approach.

## 2. Implement diagram generation module [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a standalone module for all diagram generation functionality
### Details:
Extract existing diagram code into a separate module with well-defined interfaces. Implement proper error handling for diagram generation failures. Add support for different diagram types and customization options.

Implement Mermaid diagram generation for agent architecture. The module should be able to transform agent specifications or internal representations into valid Mermaid syntax for flowcharts and other relevant diagram types. Ensure proper parsing of agent components, relationships, and workflows to generate accurate visual representations. Include support for customizing diagram appearance, such as node styles, colors, and layout options specific to Mermaid's syntax requirements.

## 3. Implement CLI output module [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop a dedicated module for handling all command-line interface outputs
### Details:
Create a module that manages all terminal output formatting, colors, and display logic. Implement consistent output patterns for different message types (errors, warnings, info). Add support for different verbosity levels.

## 4. Implement interactive features module [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Build a separate module for all interactive user interface elements
### Details:
Create a module to handle user input, interactive prompts, and dynamic content. Implement components for menus, forms, and interactive visualizations. Ensure accessibility and intuitive user experience.

## 5. Develop comprehensive error handling system [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Implement detailed error handling across all modules
### Details:
Create error types specific to each module. Implement graceful error recovery mechanisms. Add detailed error logging with contextual information. Ensure errors propagate appropriately between modules.

## 6. Implement user feedback mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Add systems for providing clear feedback to users across all interactions
### Details:
Develop progress indicators for long-running operations. Create success/failure notifications with appropriate detail levels. Implement contextual help and suggestions. Add system status indicators.
<info added on 2025-05-29T11:14:17.960Z>
1. Create progress bars for long-running operations like agent generation or validation, displaying percentage completion and estimated time remaining.
2. Implement a system for providing error suggestions to the user when generations fail, guiding them on how to fix the specification or environment.
3. Include contextual tooltips that explain common errors and their solutions.
4. Design a notification system that categorizes issues by severity (warning, error, critical) with appropriate visual indicators.
5. Add the ability for users to copy error details to clipboard for sharing or troubleshooting.

## 7. Create integration tests for module interactions [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6
### Description: Develop tests to verify proper communication between the separated modules
### Details:
Write tests that verify modules interact correctly. Test error propagation between modules. Verify user feedback appears correctly for various scenarios. Create end-to-end tests for common user workflows across modules.
