# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Docker Sandbox Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a Docker-based sandbox environment for safe execution of generated code with appropriate security constraints.
# Details:
1. Create Dockerfile for sandbox environment
2. Configure seccomp/apparmor profiles for security
3. Set up read-only filesystem with specific write permissions
4. Implement network isolation (no outbound connections by default)
5. Create sandbox API for code execution and result retrieval
6. Add resource limits (CPU, memory, execution time)
7. Include Python environment with pytest and common dependencies

# Test Strategy:
Test sandbox isolation by attempting various escape vectors. Verify resource limits work as expected. Ensure Python code can be executed and results retrieved correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Base Docker Sandbox Image with Python Environment [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a Dockerfile that sets up a secure Python environment with necessary dependencies, pytest, and basic security configurations.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a Dockerfile based on a minimal Linux image (e.g., Alpine or Debian slim)
2. Install Python 3.x and pip
3. Install pytest and common Python dependencies (numpy, pandas, requests, etc.)
4. Configure the container to run as a non-root user
5. Set up a working directory for code execution
6. Create entry point script that will handle code execution
7. Test the image by building it and verifying Python and dependencies work
8. Document the base image configuration

Testing approach:
- Build the Docker image
- Run a container with the image and verify Python version
- Execute a simple pytest to confirm the testing environment works
- Verify all specified dependencies are correctly installed

## 2. Implement Security Constraints and Resource Limits [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Configure security profiles, filesystem restrictions, network isolation, and resource limits for the sandbox environment.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create seccomp profile to restrict system calls
2. Configure AppArmor profile for additional security (if using Ubuntu/Debian)
3. Set up read-only filesystem with specific write permissions for /tmp and workspace directory
4. Implement network isolation by configuring Docker network settings to block outbound connections
5. Add resource limits in Docker run configuration:
   - CPU limits (e.g., --cpus=0.5)
   - Memory limits (e.g., --memory=512m)
   - Maximum execution time using timeout command
6. Update the Dockerfile to incorporate security configurations
7. Document all security measures implemented

Testing approach:
- Attempt operations that should be blocked (file system writes outside allowed directories, network connections)
- Verify resource limits by running CPU/memory intensive code
- Test timeout functionality with infinite loops
- Ensure legitimate operations within constraints still function correctly

## 3. Create Sandbox API for Code Execution and Result Retrieval [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Develop an API service that manages the sandbox containers, handles code submission, execution, and safe result retrieval.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a RESTful API service using Flask or FastAPI
2. Implement endpoints for:
   - Code submission
   - Execution status checking
   - Result retrieval
3. Develop container management functionality:
   - Create containers on demand
   - Pass submitted code to containers
   - Set execution timeouts
   - Collect execution results and logs
   - Clean up containers after execution
4. Implement proper error handling and security validation
5. Add logging for debugging and audit purposes
6. Create a client library or documentation for interacting with the API

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests with various code samples (valid Python, syntax errors, infinite loops, etc.)
- Test resource-intensive code execution
- Verify proper cleanup of containers
- Test concurrent code execution requests
- Ensure proper isolation between different execution requests
