# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Docker Sandbox Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a Docker-based sandbox environment for safe execution of generated code with appropriate security constraints.
# Details:
1. Create Dockerfile for sandbox environment
2. Configure seccomp/apparmor profiles for security
3. Set up read-only filesystem with specific write permissions
4. Implement network isolation (no outbound connections by default)
5. Create sandbox API for code execution and result retrieval
6. Add resource limits (CPU, memory, execution time)
7. Include Python environment with pytest and common dependencies

# Test Strategy:
Test sandbox isolation by attempting various escape vectors. Verify resource limits work as expected. Ensure Python code can be executed and results retrieved correctly.
