# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Meta Agent Orchestrator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core orchestration logic that plans the agent creation process and delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents.
# Details:
1. Initialize OpenAI Agents SDK integration
2. Implement orchestration workflow that decomposes spec into tasks
3. Create planning logic to determine tool and guardrail requirements
4. Implement sub-agent delegation framework
5. Add state management for tracking generation progress
6. Create template for final agent assembly
7. Implement retry logic for failed generations

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for orchestration logic with mocked sub-agents. Integration tests with simplified specifications to verify full workflow execution.
