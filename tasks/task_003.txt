# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Docker Sandbox Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a secure Docker container for safely executing and testing generated code
# Details:
Create Dockerfile with:
- Python base image
- Pytest installation
- Security configurations (seccomp/apparmor profiles)
- Read-only filesystem except for designated directories
- Network isolation (no outbound by default)
- Resource limits (CPU/memory)

Implement sandbox manager class to:
- Build container
- Mount generated code
- Execute tests
- Capture output
- Enforce timeouts

# Test Strategy:
Test container isolation by attempting network access; verify resource limits; ensure test results are properly captured
