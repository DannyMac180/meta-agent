# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Meta Agent Orchestrator
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core orchestration logic that plans the agent creation process and delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents.
# Details:
1. Initialize OpenAI Agents SDK integration
2. Implement orchestration workflow that decomposes spec into tasks
3. Create planning logic to determine tool and guardrail requirements
4. Implement sub-agent delegation framework
5. Add state management for tracking generation progress
6. Create template for final agent assembly
7. Implement retry logic for failed generations

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for orchestration logic with mocked sub-agents. Integration tests with simplified specifications to verify full workflow execution.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Orchestration Framework with OpenAI SDK Integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational orchestration framework that integrates with the OpenAI Agents SDK and implements the basic workflow for decomposing specifications into tasks.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Initialize the project structure with necessary dependencies including OpenAI Agents SDK
2. Create an OrchestrationManager class that handles the core workflow
3. Implement the SDK integration layer with authentication and client setup
4. Develop the specification parser that converts user requirements into structured data
5. Create the task decomposition logic that breaks down a specification into atomic tasks
6. Implement basic logging and error handling
7. Write unit tests for the specification parser and task decomposition logic
8. Test the OpenAI SDK integration with sample specifications

## 2. Develop Planning and Sub-Agent Delegation System [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Build the planning logic that determines tool and guardrail requirements for each task and implements the framework for delegating tasks to specialized sub-agents.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a PlanningEngine class that analyzes decomposed tasks
2. Implement logic to determine required tools and guardrails for each task
3. Develop a SubAgentManager to handle the creation and management of specialized sub-agents
4. Implement the delegation framework that assigns tasks to appropriate sub-agents
5. Create interfaces for sub-agent communication and result collection
6. Implement priority and dependency resolution for task execution
7. Add validation mechanisms to ensure sub-agent outputs meet requirements
8. Write integration tests for the planning engine and sub-agent delegation
9. Test with multiple sub-agents handling different types of tasks

## 3. Implement State Management and Agent Assembly System [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create the state management system for tracking generation progress, implement retry logic for failed generations, and develop the template-based final agent assembly process.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design and implement a StateManager class to track the progress of agent generation
2. Create a persistent state storage mechanism (in-memory, database, or file-based)
3. Implement checkpoint creation and restoration for long-running processes
4. Develop retry logic with configurable strategies for failed generations
5. Create a TemplateEngine for final agent assembly that combines sub-agent outputs
6. Implement validation checks for the assembled agent
7. Add reporting capabilities to provide insights on the generation process
8. Write unit and integration tests for state management and agent assembly
9. Develop end-to-end tests that verify the complete orchestration workflow from specification to final agent assembly
