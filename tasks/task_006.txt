# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create Evaluation Harness
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the system that compiles, executes, and validates the generated agent code and tests.
# Details:
1. Implement pytest runner in sandbox environment
2. Create result collection and reporting system
3. Add code compilation verification
4. Implement test coverage analysis
5. Create failure analysis for debugging
6. Add performance metrics collection
7. Generate evaluation summary report

# Test Strategy:
Test with both valid and intentionally broken agent code. Verify all issues are correctly detected and reported. Ensure sandbox security during execution.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Modular Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define clear module boundaries for code execution, result collection, and reporting within the evaluation harness.
### Details:
Create an architectural diagram and documentation outlining the responsibilities and interfaces of each module.

## 2. Implement Code Execution Module [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop the module responsible for securely executing code within a sandboxed environment.
### Details:
Ensure the module can accept code snippets, execute them in isolation, and handle timeouts or resource limits.

## 3. Implement Result Collection Module [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Develop the module that gathers outputs, errors, and execution metadata from the code execution module.
### Details:
Design interfaces for collecting standard output, error logs, exit codes, and execution statistics.

## 4. Implement Reporting Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Develop the module that formats and presents results for users, supporting various output formats (e.g., JSON, HTML).
### Details:
Ensure the module can aggregate results, generate summaries, and provide detailed reports as needed.

## 5. Integrate Detailed Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Add comprehensive logging to all modules, capturing key events, errors, and execution traces.
### Details:
Implement structured logging with configurable verbosity and log rotation policies.

## 6. Add Security Checks for Sandbox Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.5
### Description: Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access, resource abuse, and code injection within the sandbox.
### Details:
Include input validation, resource quotas, and monitoring for suspicious activity during code execution.

## 7. System Integration and Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4, 6.5, 6.6
### Description: Integrate all modules and perform end-to-end testing to ensure correct operation, security, and reliability.
### Details:
Develop test cases covering normal operation, error handling, and security edge cases. Validate logging and reporting outputs.
