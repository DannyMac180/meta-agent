# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Guardrail Designer Sub-agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the sub-agent that generates validation logic and guardrail tests
# Details:
Implement Guardrail Designer using gpt-4o model:
- Accept guardrail specifications from Meta Agent
- Generate Pydantic validators, regex patterns, and policy checks
- Create test cases that verify guardrails catch violations
- Integrate with Agents-SDK guardrail hooks
- Package as GuardrailArtifact objects

Implement common guardrail patterns (PII detection, output validation, etc.)

# Test Strategy:
Test with sample guardrail specifications; verify generated guardrails catch violations in test cases; test edge cases like complex policy rules
