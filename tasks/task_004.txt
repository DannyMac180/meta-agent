# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Tool Designer Sub-agent
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the specialized sub-agent that generates Python code for tools specified in the requirements.
# Details:
1. Configure o4-mini-high model integration
2. Implement tool code generation logic based on specifications
3. Create unit test generator for tools
4. Add web search capability for API documentation lookup
5. Implement code validation using the sandbox environment
6. Create retry/refinement loop for failed code generation
7. Add documentation generation for tools

# Test Strategy:
Test with various tool specifications. Verify generated code compiles and passes basic functionality tests. Check edge cases like complex APIs or unusual requirements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Tool Designer Core with Model Integration [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the Tool Designer sub-agent foundation with o4-mini-high model integration and implement the basic code generation logic for tools based on specifications.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a `ToolDesignerAgent` class that inherits from a base agent class
2. Configure the o4-mini-high model integration with appropriate parameters (temperature, max tokens)
3. Implement the core prompt engineering for tool code generation with appropriate context
4. Create a structured input format for tool specifications (name, description, parameters, return type)
5. Implement the main code generation method that takes a tool specification and returns Python code
6. Add basic error handling for failed generations
7. Create a simple validation function to check if generated code is syntactically correct

Testing approach:
- Unit test the code generation with simple tool specifications
- Verify the generated code compiles and has correct syntax
- Test error handling with invalid specifications

## 2. Implement Testing and Validation Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive testing and validation framework for generated tool code, including unit test generation and sandbox environment validation.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Build upon the `ToolDesignerAgent` to add a unit test generator for tools
2. Design prompts for the model to generate comprehensive test cases based on tool specifications
3. Implement the sandbox environment integration for safe code execution and validation
4. Create a validation pipeline that:
   - Checks syntax correctness
   - Runs the code in the sandbox
   - Executes generated unit tests
   - Validates against expected behavior
5. Implement a retry mechanism for failed validations that provides specific feedback
6. Add a refinement loop that iteratively improves code based on validation results
7. Track success/failure metrics for generated tools

Testing approach:
- Test with various tool complexities to ensure test generation works
- Verify sandbox containment with potentially problematic code
- Test the retry/refinement loop with intentionally flawed generations

## 3. Add Documentation and API Research Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Enhance the Tool Designer with web search capabilities for API documentation lookup and implement automatic documentation generation for created tools.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Integrate a web search capability (using an appropriate API) for looking up API documentation
2. Implement context augmentation that enriches the tool specification with relevant API documentation
3. Create a documentation generator that produces:
   - Function docstrings in standard format
   - Usage examples
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Return value documentation
4. Implement a method to format the documentation according to standards (Google style, NumPy style, etc.)
5. Add a capability to generate a standalone documentation file for complex tools
6. Enhance the code generation to incorporate the documentation findings
7. Create a final output format that includes both the code and comprehensive documentation

Testing approach:
- Test web search with various API queries
- Verify documentation completeness against standards
- End-to-end tests that generate tools with documentation
- Validate that documentation accurately reflects the code's functionality
