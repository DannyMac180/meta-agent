# Task ID: 9
# Title: Add Telemetry and Tracing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement cost tracking, performance monitoring, and execution tracing
# Details:
Implement telemetry system:
- OpenAI API usage tracking (tokens, costs)
- Latency measurements for each component
- Trace logging for agent execution
- Cost caps and alerts

Create dashboard for visualizing metrics
Integrate with Agents-SDK tracing hooks

# Test Strategy:
Verify accurate token counting and cost calculation; test latency tracking; ensure trace logs capture all relevant events
