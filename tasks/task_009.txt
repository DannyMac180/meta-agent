# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create Template and Pattern Library
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Build a library of reusable agent templates and patterns to improve generation quality and consistency.
# Details:
1. Design template storage format (JSON/YAML)
2. Create initial set of agent archetypes
3. Implement embedding-based template search
4. Add template versioning and metadata
5. Create template selection logic based on specifications
6. Implement template mixing for complex requirements
7. Add user-defined template support

# Test Strategy:
Test template retrieval with various specifications. Verify template mixing produces valid results. Test with intentionally vague specifications to ensure appropriate templates are selected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design template categorization schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a hierarchical categorization system for organizing templates by type, purpose, and complexity
### Details:
Define primary template categories (e.g., conversation, reasoning, creative), subcategories, and metadata fields needed for each template. Create a document outlining the schema with examples of how different templates would be classified.

## 2. Implement template versioning system [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop a versioning mechanism to track template changes and maintain backward compatibility
### Details:
Design version numbering scheme (semantic versioning), implement storage of template history, create diff visualization between versions, and ensure templates can be rolled back to previous versions when needed.

## 3. Build template search functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a robust search system allowing users to find templates by keywords, categories, and metadata
### Details:
Implement full-text search across template content and metadata, add filtering by category/tags, and create a relevance ranking algorithm. Include search result previews and sorting options.

## 4. Develop user-defined template creation interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Create a user interface for defining and saving custom templates
### Details:
Design a template editor with syntax highlighting, variable definition, documentation fields, and validation. Include template testing capabilities and a guided creation wizard for new users.

## 5. Implement template mixing/inheritance system [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.4
### Description: Create functionality to combine multiple templates or inherit properties from base templates
### Details:
Design a template composition system allowing templates to reference or extend others. Implement conflict resolution for overlapping instructions, variable scope management, and visual representation of template relationships.

## 6. Create template validation and testing framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4, 9.5
### Description: Build tools to validate templates and test their effectiveness
### Details:
Implement syntax checking, variable usage validation, and performance testing for templates. Create a sandbox environment for testing templates with sample inputs and expected outputs.

## 7. Develop template sharing and collaboration features [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4, 9.6
### Description: Add functionality for users to share, collaborate on, and rate templates
### Details:
Implement template export/import, sharing permissions, collaborative editing, version merging, and a rating/review system. Create a community showcase for popular templates with usage statistics.
