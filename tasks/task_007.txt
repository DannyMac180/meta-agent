# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Artifact Bundling System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the system that packages the generated agent code, tests, and dependencies into a usable bundle.
# Details:
1. Implement agent.py file generation
2. Create tests/ directory structure
3. Generate requirements.txt with proper dependency versions
4. Add README.md generation with usage instructions
5. Implement optional Git repository creation/pushing
6. Create version tracking metadata
7. Add bundle validation to ensure completeness

# Test Strategy:
Verify bundles can be installed and run in a fresh environment. Test Git repository creation and pushing. Ensure all dependencies are correctly captured.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Bundle Structure and Metadata Schema [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the deterministic on-disk layout for the artifact bundle, specifying directory structure, required files, and the JSON schema for bundle metadata (including schema_version, custom metadata fields, and extensibility hooks).
### Details:
Document the structure in bundle_layout.md and lock the metadata schema early to ensure downstream compatibility.

## 2. Implement File Generation Phase [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop logic to generate all required files for the bundle, including source code, requirements.txt, README, traces directory, and guardrails manifest. Support injection of template/pattern files and capture checksums for provenance.
### Details:
Ensure generated files match the agreed bundle layout and support future telemetry and template library integration.

## 3. Develop Dependency Management Phase [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Automate the collection and pinning of all direct and transitive dependencies, generate requirements.txt with exact versions, and optionally emit a hashes file for pip --require-hashes support. Scrape and record license information for all dependencies.
### Details:
Ensure reproducibility and compliance by capturing all necessary dependency and license data.

## 4. Integrate Custom Metadata Support [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Extend the bundle metadata schema and file generation logic to allow injection and validation of custom metadata fields, supporting future extensibility and downstream consumer requirements.
### Details:
Allow plugins or other components to add custom fields to bundle.json and ensure schema validation.

## 5. Add Optional Git Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Implement logic to detect git in PATH, initialize a local repository if requested, and support the --git-remote flag for pushing bundles. Ensure commit history and file checksums are reproducible and verifiable.
### Details:
Stub local bare repos for CI testing and ensure Git integration is optional and robust.

## 6. Develop Validation Phase [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Create a validation pipeline that compiles the agent, runs tests inside the bundle, verifies dependency integrity, checks file checksums, and validates metadata schema compliance. Refuse to emit bundles on validation failure.
### Details:
Ensure only runnable, compliant bundles are produced, mitigating risks of non-runnable or insecure artifacts.

## 7. Document API and Extensibility Hooks [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.4, 7.6
### Description: Provide a Python API helper for loading and introspecting bundles, and document pre/post-packaging extensibility hooks for future plugin integration. Ensure documentation is clear and kept in sync with implementation.
### Details:
Enable future tooling and plugin development by exposing a stable API and clear extension points.
