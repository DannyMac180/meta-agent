# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Artifact Bundling System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the system that packages the generated agent code, tests, and dependencies into a usable bundle.
# Details:
1. Implement agent.py file generation
2. Create tests/ directory structure
3. Generate requirements.txt with proper dependency versions
4. Add README.md generation with usage instructions
5. Implement optional Git repository creation/pushing
6. Create version tracking metadata
7. Add bundle validation to ensure completeness

# Test Strategy:
Verify bundles can be installed and run in a fresh environment. Test Git repository creation and pushing. Ensure all dependencies are correctly captured.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Bundle Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall architecture for the bundling process including file organization, metadata schema, and dependency representation.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive design document outlining how files will be organized within bundles, how dependencies will be tracked, and how metadata will be structured. Include support for custom metadata fields and consider how Git integration will affect the bundle structure.

## 2. Implement File Generation Phase [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop the core functionality to generate bundle files with proper structure and formatting.
### Details:
Create modules that handle the creation of bundle files, including file collection, transformation, and output generation. Ensure the system can handle different file types and maintain proper references between bundled components.

## 3. Build Dependency Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a system to track, resolve, and validate dependencies between bundled components.
### Details:
Implement algorithms to detect dependencies between components, resolve version conflicts, and ensure all required dependencies are included in the bundle. The system should handle both internal dependencies and external references.

## 4. Develop Custom Metadata Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Create a flexible system for adding, validating, and utilizing custom metadata within bundles.
### Details:
Implement functionality to define, store, and access custom metadata fields for bundles. Include validation rules for metadata and ensure the metadata can be used throughout the bundling process to influence behavior.

## 5. Implement Git Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Add optional Git integration for version control and collaboration features.
### Details:
Develop modules that interface with Git repositories to track bundle changes, manage versions, and facilitate collaboration. Make this integration optional so the system can function without Git when needed.

## 6. Create Validation Phase [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive validation checks for bundles to ensure integrity and correctness.
### Details:
Develop a validation system that checks bundles for completeness, dependency resolution, metadata correctness, and structural integrity. Include both automated validation and tools for manual inspection.

## 7. Build Integration Tests and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6
### Description: Create comprehensive tests and documentation for the entire bundling process.
### Details:
Develop end-to-end tests that verify the complete bundling process works correctly. Create detailed documentation explaining how to use the system, including examples for common use cases and troubleshooting guides.
