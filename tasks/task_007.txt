# Description: Create the system that packages the generated agent code, tests, and dependencies into a usable bundle.
# Details:
1. Implement agent.py file generation
2. Create tests/ directory structure
3. Generate requirements.txt with proper dependency versions
4. Add README.md generation with usage instructions
5. Implement optional Git repository creation/pushing
