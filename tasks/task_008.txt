# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Artifact Bundling and Dependency Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the system for packaging generated agents with dependencies and documentation
# Details:
Implement artifact bundling:
- Generate agent.py with all required imports
- Create tests/ directory with all test files
- Generate requirements.txt with pinned dependencies
- Create README.md with usage instructions
- Implement Git/S3 integration for artifact storage

Add versioning and dependency locking using pip-tools

# Test Strategy:
Verify bundled agents can be installed and run with a single command; test dependency resolution; check Git/S3 integration
