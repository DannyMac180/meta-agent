# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Cost and Trace Telemetry
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add systems to track token usage, latency, and costs associated with agent generation.
# Details:
1. Integrate with OpenAI usage APIs
2. Implement token counting and cost calculation
3. Create latency tracking for each generation step
4. Build telemetry dashboard (CLI-based initially)
5. Add cost caps and warnings
6. Implement telemetry storage for historical analysis
7. Create export functionality for telemetry data

# Test Strategy:
Verify accuracy of token counting and cost calculations. Test cost caps by creating specifications that would exceed limits. Ensure telemetry data is correctly stored and retrievable.
