      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and CLI Skeleton",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of a Python project repository with a CLI skeleton into subtasks such as initializing the project structure, implementing the CLI with argparse, creating utility modules, and configuring dependency management.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard project scaffolding and CLI setup, which is routine for experienced developers. However, ensuring best practices in structure, CLI design, and dependency setup adds moderate complexity, especially for extensibility and maintainability."
    },

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement SpecSchema and Natural Language Processing",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the implementation of SpecSchema and natural language processing into subtasks like designing Pydantic data models, integrating the OpenAI model for parsing, building validation logic, handling both text and YAML input, and writing unit tests for validation.",
      "reasoning": "Parsing and validating natural language specifications is complex due to the need for robust data modeling, integration with language models, and rigorous validation logic. Handling unstructured input and ensuring schema completeness increases the difficulty."
    },

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Build Docker Sandbox Environment",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the creation of a secure Docker sandbox by breaking it into Dockerfile setup, implementing security and resource restrictions, developing a sandbox manager class, and integrating test execution and output capture.",
      "reasoning": "Building a secure and functional sandbox involves in-depth Docker expertise, security hardening, resource management, and programmatic container control. Ensuring safety while enabling flexible code execution adds notable complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Meta Agent Orchestrator",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the orchestrator implementation into subtasks such as initializing the agent with the OpenAI SDK, developing the planning and decomposition logic, implementing sub-agent delegation, handling result aggregation, and adding error-handling and clarification mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "Orchestration of agent workflows, including decomposition, delegation, and assembly, is architecturally complex. This requires advanced planning logic, robust sub-agent interfaces, and sophisticated error handling to ensure reliability and adaptability."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Tool Designer Sub-agent",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Tool Designer sub-agent into subtasks like implementing tool code generation, creating unit test generation, integrating code validation and web search, and developing a template library for reusable patterns.",
      "reasoning": "Generating code and tests from specifications, integrating search and validation, and maintaining extensible templates demands multiple skill sets and non-trivial integration, though each component is based on established practices."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Guardrail Designer Sub-agent",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Guardrail Designer into subtasks such as implementing generation of validation logic, creating guardrail tests, integrating with SDK hooks, and building reusable guardrail patterns.",
      "reasoning": "Automating guardrail and validation logic with tests and SDK integration is complex due to the need for correctness, coverage, and extensibility, but reuses standard approaches for validation and testing."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Build Evaluation Harness",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the evaluation harness into subtasks like implementing code compilation and test running, parsing and reporting test results, verifying guardrails, and generating summary reports.",
      "reasoning": "Developing a robust evaluation system involves integrating multiple components (test runners, result parsers), but builds on well-known techniques for testing and reporting in Python environments."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Artifact Bundling and Dependency Management",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break artifact bundling into subtasks such as generating code and test bundles, creating documentation, managing dependencies and versioning, and integrating with storage solutions like Git or S3.",
      "reasoning": "While packaging and dependency management are standard, automating the process and ensuring integration with external systems like Git/S3 adds moderate complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Add Telemetry and Tracing",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide telemetry and tracing into subtasks such as implementing API usage and cost tracking, adding performance and trace logging, and building a visualization dashboard.",
      "reasoning": "Adding telemetry and tracing is well-scoped and often supported by existing SDKs, but integrating cost control and visualization requires careful design to be effective and non-intrusive."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Template Library and Diagram Generation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks such as developing the template library, implementing vector search, generating architecture diagrams, and integrating visual feedback in the CLI.",
      "reasoning": "Building reusable templates and auto-generating diagrams is moderately complex, especially when adding search and dynamic diagram generation, but leverages existing libraries and tools."
